# Job Listing Platform

## Overview

Welcome to the Job Listing Platform, a robust web application designed for job seekers and employers. The platform features a Spring Boot backend, providing a scalable and secure environment, coupled with MongoDB as the database for efficient data storage. Employers can seamlessly post job listings, and job seekers can explore and apply for available positions. The backend exposes RESTful APIs for seamless interaction.
